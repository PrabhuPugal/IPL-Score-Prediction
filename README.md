# IPL Score Prediction

## Description
**IPL Score Prediction** is a machine learning project that aims to predict the scores of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches. The application uses historical match data and various statistical models to forecast the outcomes of ongoing or upcoming matches. This project demonstrates the application of predictive analytics and machine learning techniques in sports.

## Features
- **Match Score Prediction**: Predicts the score of an IPL match based on historical data and statistical models.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides visualizations of historical match data and prediction results.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes metrics and methods to evaluate the performance of the predictive models.
- **User Interface**: A simple interface to input match details and view predictions.

## How It Works
The application uses various machine learning algorithms and statistical methods to predict match scores. Key components include:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathers historical data on IPL matches, including scores, player performance, and match conditions.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts and prepares features relevant to match predictions, such as player statistics and team performance.
3. **Model Training**: Uses algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to train models on historical data.
4. **Prediction**: Applies trained models to predict scores for new or ongoing matches.
5. **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and others.
